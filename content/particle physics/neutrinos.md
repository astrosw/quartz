title: "neutrinos"

Neutrinos are [fermions](https://astrosw.github.io/quartz/particle-physics/fermions) that only interact through [[particle physics/weak interactions]] and [[particle physics/gravity]].

They are electrically neutral and have very small rest mass.

### Where are neutrinos?

Although neutrinos are member of fermions, they cannot join the constitution of matter. They can interact only weakly and cannot be captured with other particles.
