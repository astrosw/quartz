A lepton is an elementary particle with spin 1/2 that does not interact strongly ([[strong interactions]])

Two main types of leptons:
- charged leptons: [[particle physics/electrons|electrons]] (first generation), [[particle physics/muons|muons]] (second generation), [[particle physics/tauons|tauons]] (third generation)
- neutral leptons: [[particle physics/neutrinos|neutrinos]]
