title: "Neutrino-based Communication: From New York to Tokyo, through the Earth!"

(still writing...)

***DISCLAIMER:*** *Particle Physics is not my area of study. Please let me know if you notice any mistakes or omissions.*

In this post, I'll discuss the possibility of using [[particle physics/neutrinos|neutrinos]] for communication between New York and Tokyo and answer the questions: What can we gain with neutrino-based communication in comparison to the conventional communications? What's the most challenging for developing this kind of communication?

Of course in order to discuss all that, we need to grasp the basic concepts. The first question is undoubtedly:

## What are [[particle physics/neutrinos|neutrinos]]?

Basically they are elementary particles that have neutral charge and very VERY small mass (thought to be massless for a long time). They are [[particle physics/fermions|fermions]] that interact only via the [[particle physics/weak interactions|weak interactions]] and [[particle physics/gravity|gravity]].

*Well, I do realize the above explanation is still a little vague for those who are unfamiliar with particle physics (like me). Like okay, they're fermions, but what are fermions? What exactly are elementary particles? Where do they exist in atoms, and how do they connect with other particles that we are more familiar with, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons? And so i decided to set up this site to utiliize the power of bidirectional links. You can move to the individual notes of each concept by clicking on the internal links, or you can look at how these are connected in the interactive graph at the bottom.*

## Why neutrinos for communication?

Neutrinos can essentially travel through anything and everything. They can propagate through vast cosmic distances without significant attenuation or deflection. This is because they have relatively weak interactions and can't be caught by other particles. This capability makes neutrino a potential messenger for future global point-to-point communication, communication with submarines, interstellar communication or even planetary exploration! Isn't that exciting?

*Neutrinos are often described as tiny particles or as having weak interactions. These phrases might a little bit confusing, though. "Probability of interaction is small" or "neutrino interaction is rare" are more suitable expressions to explain their penetrating characteristic.*

*The concept of cross section would be helpful in comprehending this rarity. Cross section (σ(cm<sup>2</sup>) is the size of the target particle from a view point of interaction. For example, if 1 GeV protons interact with the target nuclei, the interaction is a hadron interaction with a cross section of σ ~ 3 x 10<sup>-26</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, if 1 GeV neutrinos encounter the target nuclei, the interaction is weak, with a cross section of about σ ~ 1 x 10<sup>-38</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>. It is smaller than that of hadron interaction by a factor of 3 x 10<sup>12</sup>.*

## Operation and Challenges

### A past experiment

Neutrino-based communication is thus an intriguing concept, but is it realistic?

Weak interactions seem to provide neutrinos the benefit of penetrating matter, but this same property also suggests that very powerful beams and HUGE massive detectors would be required. These are regarded as the two major obstacles to implementing this kind of communication.

An [experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2847) had been conducted in 2012 using the NuMI beam line and the MINERvA detector to perform low-rate communications over a distance of about 1 km. 

### Path length and matter effect

In our scenario, however, we wish to send information from New York to Tokyo across the earth at a distance of about 9600 km. There have been concerns about whether the huge traveling distance might weaken the beam because it is very large in comparison to the experiment.

There are several ways to answer this.

You can use the following formula to calculate the number of particles left (N) after traveling a distance (x):
