A lepton is an elementary particle with spin 1/2 that does not interact strongly ([[strong interactions]])

Two main types of leptons:
- charged leptons: [[particle physics/elementary particles/electron]] (first generation), [[particle physics/elementary particles/muon]] (second generation), [[particle physics/elementary particles/tauon]] (third generation)
- neutral leptons: [[particle physics/elementary particles/neutrinos]]
