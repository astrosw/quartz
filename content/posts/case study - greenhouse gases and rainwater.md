## Background:

  

  

Several greenhouse gases have shown an increase in atmospheric concentration during the past 50 years, as is widely known. Let's examine the information on carbon dioxide partial pressure ($CO_2$) that was acquired at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, from 1958 to 2003. A quadratic polynomial may be used to fit the data trend neatly,

  

  

$$p_{CO_2} = 0.011825(t - 1980.5)^2+1.356975(t-1980.5) + 339$$

  

  

where $p_{CO_2}$ is the atmospheric $CO_2$ partial pressure (ppm). According to the data, $CO_2$ levels increased by more than 19% from 315 to 376 ppm.

  

  

In addition to contributing to global warming, greenhouse gases may alter the chemistry of the atmosphere. How the rise in carbon dioxide is influencing rainwater's pH is one issue we can solve. It is generally known that carbon dioxide is the main factor of the pH of the rain outside of urban and industrial regions. The activity of hydrogen ions, and hence the acidity of a solution, are measured by pH. It may be calculated as follows for diluted aqueous solutions:

$$
pH = -log_{10}{[H^+]}
\tag{1}
$$

where $[H^+]$ is the molar concentration of hydrogen ions.

The chemistry of rainfall is governed by the following five nonlinear systems of equations:

  

  

$$
K_1 = 10^6\dfrac{{[H^+]}{[HCO_3^-]}}{p_{CO_2}K_H}
\tag{2}
$$

  

$$
K_2 = \dfrac{[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]}{[HCO_3^-]}
\tag{3}
$$

  

  

$$
K_w = {[H^+]}{[OH^-]}
\tag{4}
$$

  

  

$$
c_T = \dfrac{p_{CO_2}K_H}{10^6} + {[HCO_3^-]} + {[CO_3^{2-}]}
\tag{5}
$$

  

  

$$
{[HCO_3^-]} + 2{[CO_3^{2-}]} + {[OH^-]} - {[H^+]} = 0
\tag{6}
$$

  

  

where $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_w$ are equilibrium coefficients, and $K_H$ is Henry's constant. The five unknown values are $c_T$ - total inorganic carbon, $[HCO_3^-]$ - bicarbonate, $[CO_3^{2-}]$ - carbonate, $[H^+]$ - hydrogen ion, and $[OH^-]$ - hydroxyl ion. Keep in mind that equations (2) and (5) both display the partial pressure of $CO_2$.

  

  

Now, we will apply these equations to determine the pH of rainwater given that $K_H=10^{-1.46}$, $K_1=10^{-6.3}$, $K_2=10^{-10.3}$, and $K_w=10^{-14}$. Then we will compare the results in 1958 when $p_{CO_2}=315[ppm]$ and in 2003 when $p_{CO_2}=375 [ppm]$.

  

  

Additionally, there are two criteria for choosing a numerical method for computation:

  

- You can be certain that rain in pristine places always ranges in pH from 2 to 12.

  

- You are also informed that the precision of your pH measurements is just two decimal places.

## Solution:

  

  

To begin, we may eliminate the unknown values by combining them into a single function that is solely dependent on $[H^+]$.

  

  

From (2):
$$
[HCO_3^-] = \dfrac{p_{CO_2}K_HK_1}{10^6[H^+]}
\tag*{(7)}
$$

  

From (3) and (7):

  

$$
[CO_3^{2-}] = \dfrac{p_{CO_2}K_HK_1K_2}{10^6[H^+]^2}
\tag*{(8)}
$$

  

Substitute (7), (8) and (4) into (6), we have:

  

$$
\dfrac{p_{CO_2}K_HK_1}{10^6[H^+]} + 2\dfrac{p_{CO_2}K_HK_1K_2}{10^6[H^+]^2} + \dfrac{K_w}{[H^+]} - [H^+] = 0
\tag*{(9)}
$$

  

It might not be instantly evident, but this result is a third-order polynomial in $[H^+]$. Its root may therefore be used to determine the pH of rainwater.

  

  

Next, choose the numerical method that will be applied to find the answer. Bisection would be a wise decision for two reasons. First, the fact that the pH typically falls between 2 and 12 gives us two reliable first guesses. Second, we will accept an absolute error of $E_{a,d} = 0.005$ as the pH can only be measured to two decimal places of precision. Keep in mind that we may calculate the number of iterations a priori given an initial bracket and the desired relative error. Using $n = log_2(\dfrac{\Delta x^0}{E_{a,d}})$, the result is $n = log_2(\dfrac{12-2}{0.005}) \approx 10.9658$. Bisection will therefore give the required precision after eleven iterations.

  

  

Prior to applying equation (9) to MATLAB, we must make a few adjustments in order. The left-handed side of (9) must be rewritten as a function of pH since we want to use the range from 2 to 12 with 11 iterations.

Now we can substitute $p_{CO_2}=315$ and $p_{CO_2}=375$ to the MATLAB script below:

end

  

  

fprintf("\n\nThe root of the equation is %i\n",xr);

  

  

fprintf("\nThe relative error is is %i percent\n",ea);

  

```

  

  

The result for 1958 will be a pH of 5.6279 with a relative error of 0.0868%.

It's interesting that these results show that the 19% increase in atmospheric $CO_2$ levels has only resulted in a pH decrease of 0.67%. Although this is undoubtedly true, keep in mind that equation (1) describes the pH as a logarithmic scale. As a result, a pH change of one unit corresponds to a 10-fold increase in hydrogen ions. The concentration can be determined using the formula $[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$, with a resultant percent change of 9.1%. Consequently, there has been a 9% rise in the hydrogen ion concentration.
