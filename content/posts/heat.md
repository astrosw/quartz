## What is heat?
Heat is defined in thermodynamics as energy transferred to or from a thermodynamic system by methods other than thermodynamic work or matter transfer (e.g. radiation, conduction, convection).

Heat is an expression of the kinetic energy of the atoms in a material. We experience heat when atoms are traveling very swiftly, and cold when they are moving very slowly. You can't feel individual atoms, just large groups of atoms. And yet, you can feel how that atom is jiggling rapidly because if you touch it, the fast jiggling of the atoms would brush up against the atoms of your skin, making them jiggle faster as well. If they bounce too fast, they can actually pull away the chemical bonds in your skin, causing you to burn yourself. That's why we've evolved to be able to detect how quickly atoms move. It's as if we had little atomic speedometers at our fingers.

Each atomic mode of motion has approximately 1/2 KT of energy. This is how the temperature is truly defined. The temperature is denoted by the letter T. The Boltzmann constant is denoted by the letter K. So, suppose you have a gas made up of single atoms. Because physical space has three dimensions, a single atom gas like this has 3/2 KT of energy, one for each of the three dimensions of physical space.

Then consider a molecule like oxygen, one of the principal gases in our environment. O<sub>2</sub> contains two atoms that can vibrate relative to one other. This vibration creates another mode of motion (vibrational mode) in which the molecule can transport heat. And the fact that it's now a line rather than a point implies that it may spin. And because this atom has two distinct rotational dimensions, it also has two rotation modes. So we have three modes for each atom in the molecule, for a total energy of 6/2 KT.

## How can you warm up something in space?
As previously stated, there are three primary ways of heat transfer in the universe: conduction, convection, and radiation.

- Conduction happens when neighboring atoms and molecules interact, delivering energy to their neighbors. This occurs mostly within a solid and between solid objects that are in thermal contact. It's the heat you feel when you place your palm on a window pane on sunny days.
- Convection is the flow of fluid that transfers heat from one location to another. Convection is generally described as a separate mechanism of heat transfer, although it really incorporates the combined processes of conduction and [[advection]] (heat transfer by bulk fluid flow). Convection is the most common form of heat transmission in liquids and gases.
- Radiation is produced when heat from the thermal motion of particles in matter is transformed to electromagnetic radiation. It's the heat you feel on your face when you're near to a fire. Thermal radiation is emitted by all stuff that has a temperature higher than [[absolute zero]]. Sunshine, or solar radiation, is thermal radiation emitted by the sun's very hot gasses, which heats our planet.

Because there is no air in space, convection cannot occur. Convection needs a fluid flow, which the vacuum of space precludes. That leaves conduction and radiation. You may either connect a hot object to the thing you wish to warm up or employ some type of electromagnetic radiation, such as rotating the object toward the Sun.
