## What is Heat?

Alright, let’s break it down. In thermodynamics, heat is basically energy moving in or out of a system—_but_ not in the form of work or matter transfer. Instead, it moves around through radiation, conduction, or convection.

At its core, heat is all about motion. Specifically, the motion of atoms. When atoms are zooming around like crazy, we experience heat. When they’re sluggish, we feel cold. You don’t actually _feel_ individual atoms moving, but when a whole bunch of them jiggle against your skin, your own atoms start jiggling faster too. If they go _way_ too fast, they can even break the chemical bonds in your skin—aka, you burn yourself. So, in a way, your fingers are like tiny atomic speedometers, constantly sensing how fast atoms are wiggling.

Now, here’s where things get nerdy. Each "mode" of atomic movement holds about **1/2 kT** of energy. Here, **T** is temperature, and **k** is Boltzmann’s constant (basically the conversion factor between energy and temperature).

If you’ve got a gas made of single atoms, those atoms are free to move in three dimensions, so their total energy is **3/2 kT**. But molecules like oxygen (**O₂**) add an extra twist—literally. Since they’re made of two atoms, they can vibrate relative to each other, adding a whole new way to store energy. Also, because they’re shaped like tiny dumbbells rather than single points, they can rotate in space. That gives them two more energy modes. When you tally it up, an **O₂** molecule carries around **6/2 kT** of energy. More movement, more heat storage!

## How Do You Warm Things Up in Space?

We’ve got three main ways to move heat around:

- **Conduction**: Atoms bump into each other and transfer energy, like when you touch a hot metal pan and immediately regret your choices. This mostly happens in solids or between objects in direct contact.
- **Convection**: Heat gets carried around by flowing liquids or gases. Think of how a pot of water heats up on a stove or how warm air rises in your room. Technically, this is a mix of conduction and [[advection]] (aka heat transfer by bulk fluid motion).
- **Radiation**: Heat gets turned into electromagnetic waves—aka infrared radiation—which then travel through space. That warm feeling on your face when you’re near a fire? That’s thermal radiation in action.

But here’s the problem: _space is a vacuum_. No air, no fluids—so **convection is out of the picture**. That leaves conduction and radiation. You can either stick a hot object directly onto something to warm it up (**conduction**) or blast it with electromagnetic waves (**radiation**). If you want to warm up a spacecraft, for example, you either need to turn it toward the Sun or use onboard heaters that radiate infrared energy. That’s why space stations have heaters, why the Moon’s surface can get scorching hot in direct sunlight but bitterly cold in shadow, and why astronauts' spacesuits have built-in temperature control systems.

%% Basically, in space, heat transfer gets _weird_. No air, no convection—just conduction (if you’re touching something) and radiation (if you’re absorbing or emitting energy). %%


%% ## What is heat?
Heat is defined in thermodynamics as energy transferred to or from a thermodynamic system by methods other than thermodynamic work or matter transfer (e.g. radiation, conduction, convection).

Heat is an expression of the kinetic energy of the atoms in a material. We experience heat when atoms are traveling very swiftly, and cold when they are moving very slowly. You can't feel individual atoms, just large groups of atoms. And yet, you can feel how that atom is jiggling rapidly because if you touch it, the fast jiggling of the atoms would brush up against the atoms of your skin, making them jiggle faster as well. If they bounce too fast, they can actually pull away the chemical bonds in your skin, causing you to burn yourself. That's why we've evolved to be able to detect how quickly atoms move. It's as if we had little atomic speedometers at our fingers.

Each atomic mode of motion has approximately 1/2 KT of energy. This is how the temperature is truly defined. The temperature is denoted by the letter T. The Boltzmann constant is denoted by the letter K. So, suppose you have a gas made up of single atoms. Because physical space has three dimensions, a single atom gas like this has 3/2 KT of energy, one for each of the three dimensions of physical space.

Then consider a molecule like oxygen, one of the principal gases in our environment. O<sub>2</sub> contains two atoms that can vibrate relative to one other. This vibration creates another mode of motion (vibrational mode) in which the molecule can transport heat. And the fact that it's now a line rather than a point implies that it may spin. And because this atom has two distinct rotational dimensions, it also has two rotation modes. So we have three modes for each atom in the molecule, for a total energy of 6/2 KT.

## How can you warm up something in space?
As previously stated, there are three primary ways of heat transfer in the universe: conduction, convection, and radiation.

- Conduction happens when neighboring atoms and molecules interact, delivering energy to their neighbors. This occurs mostly within a solid and between solid objects that are in thermal contact. It's the heat you feel when you place your palm on a window pane on sunny days.
- Convection is the flow of fluid that transfers heat from one location to another. Convection is generally described as a separate mechanism of heat transfer, although it really incorporates the combined processes of conduction and [[advection]] (heat transfer by bulk fluid flow). Convection is the most common form of heat transmission in liquids and gases.
- Radiation is produced when heat from the thermal motion of particles in matter is transformed to electromagnetic radiation. It's the heat you feel on your face when you're near to a fire. Thermal radiation is emitted by all stuff that has a temperature higher than [[absolute zero]]. Sunshine, or solar radiation, is thermal radiation emitted by the sun's very hot gasses, which heats our planet.

Because there is no air in space, convection cannot occur. Convection needs a fluid flow, which the vacuum of space precludes. That leaves conduction and radiation. You may either connect a hot object to the thing you wish to warm up or employ some type of electromagnetic radiation, such as rotating the object toward the Sun. %%
