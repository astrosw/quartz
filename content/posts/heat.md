Heat is an expression of the amount of kinetic energy that the atoms in a substance has.

In thermodynamics, heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system, by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter (e.g. radiation, conduction, convection).

So when atoms are moving around very quickly, that feels hot to us and if they are moving very slowly, that feels cold. You can't feel individual atoms, though, it is the huge collections of atoms that you feel. And yet, how that atom is jiggling, you can feel that instantly, because if you touch it, the fast jiggling of the atoms will bump up against the atoms of your skin and make those jiggle more quickly too. And if they jiggle too quickly, they can actually rip apart the chemical bonds of your skin and that's how you burn yourself, and that's why we have evolved to be able to sense how fast the atoms are wiggling around. So it's like we have little atomic speedometers in our fingertips.

So it turns out that each mode of motion of the atoms contains on average 1/2 KT of energy. So this is actually how the temperature is defined. This T is the temperature. K is the Boltzmann constant.

So if you have a gas that consists of single atoms. Because there are 3 dimensions of physical space, it turns out that a single atom gas like this will tend to have 3/2 KT of energy, one for each of the 3 dimensions of physical space.

And then if you have a molecule like oxygen, one of the main gasses in our atmosphere, O<sub>2</sub> has 2 atoms and these two atoms can vibrate relative to each other
