I'm hiding this one from the Recent Posts column by changing the date because of... aesthetic reasons. It's incomplete and I have some unserious notes down there. This is the most recent writing by the way.

Soooo our professor gave us a list of topics to give a group presentation (2 members each group) as our midterm exam (course Modern Astrophysics) and my teammate and I chose this.

Why?

Cuz we don't know anything about this xD it's fun to learn something new.

I'll be updating this post as we dig into this topic.
