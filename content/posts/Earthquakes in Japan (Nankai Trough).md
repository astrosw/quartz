Japan is renowned for its high seismic activity, a consequence of its unique position at the convergence of four tectonic plates: the Pacific, Philippine Sea, North American, and Eurasian plates  [^2]$^,$ [^1]. These dynamic interactions have shaped the islands’ geography and culture but have also exposed the nation to frequent earthquakes, some of which have been devastating. Central to understanding Japan’s seismic activity is the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate along the Japan Trench in the northeast and the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Nankai Trough and Sagami Trough in the southwest [^2]$^,$ [^3].

Japan’s seismicity is also influenced by the complex fault systems across the islands, such as the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line and the Niigata-Kobe Tectonic Zone, which accommodate significant crustal deformation [^4]. Recent geodetic studies utilizing the GEONET GPS network reveal the extent of strain accumulation and fault motion, providing insights into earthquake cycles and the segmentation of subduction zones [^4]$^,$ [^1]. These studies emphasize Japan’s seismic complexity, with oblique convergence resulting in both dip-slip and strike-slip faulting [^1]. Additionally, seafloor borehole tiltmeters have been deployed to measure geodetic and seismic phenomena in real-time, which help to improve our understanding of tectonic strain and early earthquake signals [^5].


## Nankai Trough: Past, Present, and Future

>Yellow dots indicate epicenters of very low frequency earthquakes [^10]$^,$ [^11]$^,$ [^12]$^,$ [^13]$^,$ [^14] and green dots represent tremors [^15]$^,$ [^16]. Blue and red stars indicate the epicenters of the 1944 Tonankai and 1946 Nankai earthquakes, respectively. The rupture areas of these earthquakes are represented by the red and blue dashed lines [^17]$^,$ [^18]. Reprinted from Flores et al. (2024)[^19].


Among the various subduction zones, the Nankai Trough stands out due to its regular seismicity and significant societal risks. Historical records dating back to 684 AD document cycles of great earthquakes along the trough, typically occurring in pairs or sequences separated by intervals of approximately 90 to 150 years [^3]. For example, the Hoei Earthquake of 1707 ruptured all segments of the Nankai Trough, generating a massive tsunami that devastated coastal communities [^3]. More recent events, such as the 1944 Tonankai and 1946 Nankaido earthquakes, ruptured the eastern and western segments, respectively, providing modern research with valuable data on fault mechanics and tsunami generation [^6]$^,$[^3].


Research on the Nankai Trough has revealed that the seismic cycle is driven by elastic strain accumulation at the plate interface, where the subducting Philippine Sea Plate drags the overriding Eurasian Plate downward. This strain is eventually released in catastrophic ruptures, with fault slip vectors and seismic waveforms indicating low-angle thrust faulting along the plate boundary [^7]$^,$[^6]$^,$[^3]. Studies in geodetic imaging have shown variations in slip deficit that correlate with regions of past earthquake ruptures [^8]$^,$[^1]. Additionally, slow-slip events (SSEs) have been observed along the Nankai Trough, which might indicate that transient aseismic slip may be altering stress distribution and influencing the likelihood of future megathrust events [^9].

Currently, the Nankai Trough is the subject of intense monitoring and research due to warnings of a potential once-in-a-century earthquake. Studies have identified a high probability of a megathrust event occurring within the next few decades, with simulations predicting that such an earthquake could reach a magnitude of 8.0 to 9.0 and cause widespread damage across western Japan [^3]$^,$ [^8]. The likelihood of successive M8 twin ruptures within a short time frame has been estimated at 4.3–96\% [^20]. Mechanical coupling studies suggest that stress accumulation in specific regions may determine the rupture behavior of future megathrust earthquakes [^21]. The anticipated rupture could involve multiple segments of the trough, similar to the Hoei Earthquake, and generate tsunamis capable of flooding densely populated coastal areas [^3].


## Solutions and Future Directions

Efforts to understand and reducing the risks associated with the Nankai Trough have led to initiatives such as the Nankai Trough Seafloor Observation Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (N-net), which aims to fill gaps in seismic monitoring through an expanded offshore observation network [^22]. Additionally, offshore drilling projects, such as the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE), have provided insights into the physical properties of the fault zone, including temperature, pressure, and fluid dynamics, which influence earthquake nucleation [^23].

The improvement of seismic and tsunami early warning systems like Japan’s Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system, operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), has already proven effective in providing seconds to minutes of warning before ground shaking begins [^24]. Kawaguchi et al. (2014)[^25] discussed the development of the DONET (Dense Ocean-floor Network System) for earthquake and tsunami monitoring in Japan. Another priority is the reinforcement of infrastructure, particularly in regions at high risk of ground shaking and tsunami inundation. Urban planning should prioritize the relocation of critical facilities, such as hospitals and emergency response centers, to higher ground or earthquake-resistant structures. Modifying existing buildings with advanced seismic isolation systems can reduce casualties and economic losses [^26]$^,$ [^27].

Public education and community engagement play an important role in disaster preparation. Regular drills, clear evacuation routes, and accessible information about earthquake and tsunami risks can encourage residents to respond effectively during an emergency [^28]$^,$ [^29]. Initiatives which emphasize individual decision-making and swift evacuation, have been credited with saving lives during the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake and Tsunami and could be adapted for the Nankai Trough region [^30]$^,$ [^31].

On the scientific front, continued research into the mechanics of subduction zones and earthquake prediction is essential. Machine learning algorithms and dense sensor networks offer new opportunities for detecting precursory signals and understanding subduction zone mechanics or estimating the probability of earthquake occurrences [^32]$^,$ [^20].
