# Background

There are various ways to extend and improve upon the [[ebm0d|zero-dimensional energy]] balance model (EBM). One approach is to consider the vertical dimension of the climate system, which can be achieved through a simple idealization known as the one-layer generalization of the zero-dimensional EBM that we discussed in the previously. While the incoming solar radiation exhibits symmetry with respect to longitude but significant variation with latitude, it becomes important to incorporate the latitudinal dimension to gain further insights into the climate system using a relatively simple and manageable model.

This leads us to the concept of the one-dimensional energy balance model. In this model, we explicitly divide the Earth into latitudinal bands while assuming uniformity with respect to longitude. By introducing latitude as a parameter, we can more realistically capture processes that exhibit strong latitudinal variations, such as ice feedbacks. Ice tends to be concentrated in higher latitude regions, and including the latitudinal component allows us to better represent these important phenomena.

We shall accomplish this by dividing the northern hemisphere into nine 10-degree latitude sections. The following figure depicts the general geometry:

![[ebm2.png]]
In an energy balance model, the main goal is to account for all heat flows in and out of the system. In the model we are examining, both the solar flux and albedo vary with latitude. The solar flux is denoted by $S_i$ and the albedo is denoted by $\alpha_i$, where i ranges from 1 to 9 representing different latitude bands. The incoming heat flow for our system would be:

$$
P_{gain} = \frac{S_i(1-\alpha_i)}{4}
$$
According to Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the outgoing longwave radiation is:

$$
R_i = \sigma T^4_i = A + BT_i
$$
where A and B are experiment parameters.

Furthermore, if a particular latitude band is colder or warmer than the average global temperature, there will be a heat flow into or out of that region. We make the assumption that this heat flow is linearly dependent on the temperature difference between the specific region and the global temperature. In other words, the heat flow can be represented as $k_t$ multiplied by the temperature difference $(T_i - T_{avg})$, where $k_t$ represents the diffusivity. The energy exchange among latitudinal bands is thus:

$$
F_i = k_t(T_i - T{avg})
$$
Energy balance gives us:
$$
P_{gain} = P_{loss}
$$
or:
$$
S_i(1-\alpha(T_i)) = R(T_i) + F(T_i)
$$
Therefore:
$$
T_i = \frac{S_i(1-\alpha_i)+k_tT_{avg}-A}{B+k_t}
$$

- EPSILON: A small value used to check for stable conditions in the model.
- A and B: Parameters for the infrared radiation formula, representing infrared cooling and a temperature-dependent term.
- K: The diffusivity constant, which controls the rate of heat transfer among the latitudinal bands.
- TEMP\_C1 and TEMP\_C2: Temperature thresholds for the albedo parameterization, indicating the presence or absence of ice cover.

EPSILON = 1.*10**-6   #Small value to check the stable condition of the Model

SOL_FRAC = np.array([0.30475,0.29725,0.28,0.25525,0.223,0.1925,0.156,0.13275,0.125])
SOL_FLUX = S0*SOL_FRAC   #incoming solar flux at each latitudinal band
# SOL_FLUX = np.array(SOL_FLUX)
```

# Variables

- alb: An array to store the albedo value for each latitudinal band.
- temp: An array to store the temperature of each latitudinal band.
- temp\_ini and temp\_pre: Additional arrays for storing initial and previous.

```python
# Initiate zero arrays
no_latbands
# variables
alb = np.zeros(no_latbands)
temp = np.zeros(no_latbands)
temp_ini = np.zeros(no_latbands)
temp_pre = np.zeros(no_latbands)
```

# Estimating surface area of each band

```python
band_width = 90/no_latbands                                            # number of degrees in each zone

# midpoint of each band
lats = []                                                              
for i in np.arange(2.,90 - band_width/2.,band_width):
    lat = i
    lats.append(lat)
lats = np.array(lats)

# midpoint of each band in radians:
lats_rad = lats*np.pi/180

# half the number of radians in each band:
delta_rad = (np.pi/2)/no_latbands/2                          # =====> dp/2

# fraction of the surface of the sphere in each latitudinal band
lats_frac = np.sin(lats_rad + delta_rad) - np.sin(lats_rad - delta_rad)
```

# Albedo for each band and mean albedo

The array alb is initially assigned the values of ALB\_ICE\_FREE, representing the albedo for each latitudinal band without ice cover. alb\_sum is calculated by summing the product of each albedo value and its corresponding surface area fraction. alb\_mean is obtained by dividing alb\_sum by the sum of the surface area fractions.

```python
alb = ALB_ICE_FREE
alb_sum = 0
for i in range(1,no_latbands+1):
    alb_sum += alb[i-1]*lats_frac[i-1]
alb_mean = alb_sum/sum(lats_frac)
```

# Function for finding temperature

The code below defines a function called ebm1d (one-dimensional energy balance model) to find the equilibrium temperature for a planet with multiple latitudinal bands. 

## Function setup

- The function takes four input parameters: a, b, k, and i.
- a, b, and k represent the parameters A, B, and K used in the energy balance equations.
- i is a flag indicating whether the planet has ice cover (i = 1) or not (i = 0).
- The function also includes global variables that are used within the function.

## Iterative calculations

- The function initializes the temp array with an initial temperature estimate based on the mean albedo and solar constant.
- It sets up iteration parameters such as the maximum number of steps (max\_steps), the maximum temperature difference (max\_temp\_diff), and the tolerance for temperature difference (tol\_temp\_diff).
- It also sets the values of the global variables A, B, and K to the provided input parameters.

## Iterative loop

- The code enters a while loop that continues until either the maximum number of steps is reached or the maximum temperature difference falls below the tolerance level.
- Inside the loop, the previous temperature values are stored in temp\_pre, and the step number is incremented.
- The albedo values are calculated based on whether the planet has ice cover or not.
	- If i = 1, indicating ice cover, all latitudinal bands are assigned the ALB\_ICE value.
	- If i = 0, indicating no ice cover, the albedo values are determined based on the temperature thresholds TEMP\_C1 and TEMP\_C2. If the temperature of a band is below TEMP\_C2, the band is assigned the ALB\_ICE value. If the temperature is above TEMP\_C1, the band is assigned the corresponding value from the ALB\_ICE\_FREE array. For temperatures between TEMP\_C2 and TEMP\_C1, the albedo is calculated using linear interpolation.
- The updated albedo values are stored in the alb array.
- The function calculates the average temperature (temp\_avg) weighted by the surface area fractions (lats\_frac).
- The equilibrium temperatures for each latitudinal band are updated using the energy balance equation.
- The maximum temperature difference between the current and previous iteration is calculated.


```python
def ebm1d(a,b,k,i):

        step_num+=1

            for j in range(1,no_latbands+1):
                if (temp_pre[j-1] <= TEMP_C2):

                    # print('2')
                else:
                    alb[j-1] = ALB_ICE + (ALB_ICE_FREE[j-1] - ALB_ICE)*(temp_pre[j-1] - TEMP_C2)/(TEMP_C2 - TEMP_C1)
                    # alb[j-1] = (TEMP_C1 - temp_pre[j-1])/(TEMP_C1 - TEMP_C2) * ALB_ICE + (temp_pre[j-1] - TEMP_C2)/(TEMP_C1 - TEMP_C2)*ALB_ICE_FREE[j-1]
                    # print('3')
        alb = np.array(alb)
        #update temperature:
        temp_avg = sum(np.multiply(lats_frac,temp))
        # print(alb)
        temp = (np.multiply(SOL_FLUX,(1-alb)) + K*temp_avg - A)/(B+K)
        max_temp_diff = max(abs(temp_pre - temp))
    array = np.array([lats,temp,alb])
    array = np.transpose(array)
    index_vals = np.arange(1,no_latbands+1,1)
    column_vals = ['Latitude (degree)','Equilibrium Temperature (degC)','Equilibrium Albedo']
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = array, index = index_vals, columns = column_vals)
    display(df)
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.plot(lats,temp,c='maroon',lw=2,label='Equil. Temperature (degC)')

By dividing the Earth into latitudinal bands, the model incorporates the latitudinal variations in factors such as solar radiation, heat transfer, and temperature gradients. This allows for a more realistic representation of climate dynamics and the study of processes like heat redistribution, energy balance, and temperature variations across different latitudes. While still a simplified model, the one-dimensional energy balance model provides a valuable tool for exploring climate phenomena and gaining a deeper understanding of the climate system.

With the function created above, all we have to do now is to enter the parameters A, B, K and decide whether we want to find solar flux for the case Earth is entirely covered by ice or not.

# Examples

## Estimate the value of solar flux so that the Earth will be entirely covered by ice

For this case, I entered the values for A, B and K, and i = 1 to notify that this is an icy case. The solar flux for each latitudinal band can be found in the following table:

Apparently, the equilibrium albedo remains constant at 0.62 for all bands because this is what I defined in the function for an icy planet (although I think this could be improved by defining more complex assumptions). The equilibrium temperatures and solar fluxes, on the other hand, both decreases with the increase in latitudes. We can also see that the temperatures are all extremely low (the highest temperature at the lowest latitude is only -33.3$\degree$ C). This seems to be correct for the case of an icy planet.

## Different K values

Budyko (1969) let $k_t=3.81$.

![[05_A-204.0_B-2.17_K-3.81_not icy.png]]

With K = 3.74, the equilibrium temperatures show a similar pattern to the previous case. The highest temperature occurs at the lowest latitude (2.0 degrees) with a value of 29.99$\degree$C, while the lowest temperature is observed at the highest latitude (82.0 degrees) with a value of -13.33$\degree$C. The equilibrium albedos also increase with latitudes and remain 0.62 for the three highest latitude bands, indicating a complete ice cover there. The solar flux values decrease with increasing latitude, as in the previous case. One thing we do need to notice here is that while the solar fluxes and equilibrium albedos are the same for both values of K, there are slight changes in the values of equilibrium temperatures, where for K = 3.74, we have a wider range of temperatures compared to K = 3.81. The highest temperature of the case K = 3.74 is higher than for K = 3.81 and the lowest temperature of K = 3.74 is also lower than for K = 3.81. This difference is obviously caused by how we calculated the equilibrium temperatures using the Stefan Boltzmann law.

# Physical meanings

A and B represent the parameters in the energy balance equation. A represents the infrared cooling term, and B represents the temperature-dependent term. A higher value of A indicates a stronger cooling effect, while a higher value of B indicates a higher sensitivity of temperature to changes in the radiative balance.

The equilibrium temperature distribution obtained from the model represents the steady-state temperature distribution of the planet based on the energy balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. The temperature decreases with increasing latitude due to the decreasing solar flux and the impact of the albedo.

The equilibrium albedo distribution represents the reflection of solar radiation by the planet's surface. The albedo is influenced by the presence of ice cover, which tends to increase the reflectivity and hence the albedo.

The solar flux values indicate the amount of solar radiation received by each latitudinal band. It decreases with increasing latitude due to the oblique angle of sunlight at higher latitudes.
