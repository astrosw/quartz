>*One could say, in fact, that no story really has a beginning, and that no story really has an end, as all of the world's stories are as jumbled as the items in the arboretum, with their details and secrets all heaped together so that the whole story, from beginning to end, depends on how you look at it.*

Welcome to my [digital arboretum](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)!

Hey, I’m Ngân (Ryan), an aspiring researcher with a habit of collecting thoughts and sometimes leaving them half-baked like an unripe avocado. This is my little corner of the internet where I stash ideas,  #notes,  #notebooks ,  #discussions, personal  #projects, and whatever else pops into my orbit. Some notes are polished, some are  #incomplete  scribbles, and a few might just be  #empty placeholders waiting for future me to figure things out. Consider this a living, evolving brain-dump.

Now, if you’re wondering why there are penguins 🐧 waddling around an arboretum… honestly, same. I just rolled with it.

<!-- And why is it *L'arboretum*? Claire, it's French ✨! -->

# Lost in the trees? Don't worry, I've got a map 

You can hop between posts and notes by clicking on **[[daisyworld|links like this]]** inside each page or by using the **interactive map**. If you're on a desktop, you’ll find it on the **right side** of the page. On mobile? Scroll down, it’s waiting at the **bottom**. There are also handy buttons on the bottom right to:  
🧭 **Open the global map** (for the adventurous)  
🎲 **Pick a random post** (for the chaotic)  
⬆️⬇️ **Jump to the top/bottom** (for the efficient)

Feeling extra lost? There's a **search tool** 🔍 at the top (or just hit `Ctrl+K`) to dig through the archives.

Or if you just wanna see what kind of rabbit holes I’ve fallen into, here are some of my main topics:

- 🪐 **#planetary-science** & **#climate** (mostly modeling),
- 🌌 **#astrophysics**,
- ⚛️ **#particle** **#physics**,
- 🧪 **#chemistry** (more like _physical_ chemistry, really),
- 📡 or completely random topics I’ll probably never revisit (_lol_), like **#image-processing,  #seismology,  #earthquakes**
- and [**even more stuff**](https://thdngan.github.io/arboretum/tags/)!

Go ahead, click around - I promise no black holes 🕳️🐧.

I stumbled upon [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) while on a quest to find a way to publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes on a [[neutrino communication|neutrino application]]. What followed was an absolute **blast** (and, let’s be real, a mild headache) as I set up my own digital arboretum. Turns out, wrestling with front-end stuff when you’re a total noob is both exciting and painful - 10/10 would recommend, but also, _send help_.

That said, the struggle was so worth it! I picked up a ton of new knowledge along the way, and this little blog wouldn’t exist without [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0) and the incredible tool they built. Huge thanks for making this possible!

I wrote blogs across a variety of platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[posts/neutrino communication|neutrino application]] and soon realized that it would be way more effective and intriguing to explain the intricate world of Particle Physics by linking bi-directionally to all the other concepts it's tangled up with. This led me to the idea of publishing my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and during my search, I discovered [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).
