Welcome to my [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)! This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time. In contrast to a blog, the contents aren't precisely arranged by the date they were published, and the [[my topics|topics]] layout is a reflection of my own preferences and way of thinking.

## Why this place?

I had been writing blogs using many platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[neutrino application]] and quickly realized that it is difficult to sum up the neutrino concept in a few words due to its interconnection with so many other particle physics ideas. I figured that using evergreen notes with bi-directional links would make most of them easier to understand. So I took a look at my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes and thought, "Why not publish them and use them for my posts?"

I've had a lot of fun setting up my own garden (and a little headache because I'm new to all of this haha). Many thanks to [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) for creating this incredible tool!

## How to navigate

The best part about this digital garden is that you can simply move from note to note by clicking on internal links on each page or on the nodes of the interactive graph at the bottom. You can also use the search tool at the top to look for pages and keywords.
