>*One could say, in fact, that no story really has a beginning, and that no story really has an end, as all of the world's stories are as jumbled as the items in the arboretum, with their details and secrets all heaped together so that the whole story, from beginning to end, depends on how you look at it.*

>&mdash; Lemony Snicket, The End


Hello there, I'm Ngan (Ryan) - a student majoring in Space Science. Welcome to my [digital arboretum](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)! This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time.

*You might be wondering why there are penguins in an arboretum. Well, I don't know either xD This is just a weird combination of my favourite stuff lol*



## How to navigate

  
You can easily navigate between notes by clicking on internal links within each page or by using the nodes on the interactive graph. If you're on a desktop, the graph is located on the right side of the page, and if you're using a mobile device, you can find it at the bottom of the page. You can also use the search tool 🔍 at the top (or **Ctrl + K**) to look for posts and keywords. Alternatively, you may look at a list of my [topics here](https://thdngan.github.io/quartz/subjects/ ):

- Some cool [[astrophysics|astrophysics]] stuff           ﾟ.+:｡∩(・ω・)∩ﾟ.+:｡
- Awesome [[climate n weather|Climate Modelling & Planetary Science]]           ﾟ+.ﾟ(\*´∀\`)bﾟ+.ﾟ
- [[image processing|Signal & Image Processing (just image for now lol)]]     (´ｰ｀).｡\*･ﾟﾟ
- or me babbling about [[particle physics|particle physics]]     ～(´∀｀～)

## Why this place?

I wrote blogs across a variety of platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[posts/neutrino communication|neutrino application]] and it soon hit me that it would be way more effective and intriguing to explain the intricate world of Particle Physics by bi-directional linking to all the other concepts it's tangled up with. So I thought, "Why not publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes? It is literally *thee* perfect choice!". The thing is, I'm just a broke student :'> I can't really afford monthly $20 for Obsidian Publish, and fortunately there's an amazing *free* alternative - [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

I've had so much fun setting up my own garden, *and \*coughs\* a little \*coughs\* headache because I was truly a noob and I messed up* ***a lot***. Many thanks to [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0) for creating this incredible tool!
