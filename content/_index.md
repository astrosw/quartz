title: The Arboretum
---
Hello there, I'm Ryan. Welcome to my [digital arboretum](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)! This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time. In contrast to a blog, the contents aren't precisely arranged by the date they were published, and the layout is a reflection of my own preferences and way of thinking.

*I know the penguins seem out of place given the whole gardening theme, but heyyy aren't they adorable? They are my own drawings!*

## How to navigate

You can simply move from note to note by clicking on internal links on each page or on the nodes of the interactive graph at the bottom. You can also use the search tool at the top (or Ctrl + K) to look for pages and keywords. Alternatively, you may look at a list of my [topics here](https://thdngan.github.io/quartz/subjects) or click on tags to look for notes in the same categories.

## Why this place?

I wrote blogs across a variety of platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[posts/neutrino communication|neutrino application]] and soon realized that the neutrino concept would be simpler to grasp using bidirectional links due to its interconnection with so many other particle physics concepts. So I thought, "Why not publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes and utilize them for my blogs?"

I've had a lot of fun setting up my own garden (and a little headache because I'm new to all of this haha). Many thanks to Jacky Zhao for creating this incredible [tool](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)!
