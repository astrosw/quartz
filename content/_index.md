>*One could say, in fact, that no story really has a beginning, and that no story really has an end, as all of the world's stories are as jumbled as the items in the arboretum, with their details and secrets all heaped together so that the whole story, from beginning to end, depends on how you look at it.*

Hello there, I'm Ngan (Ryan) - a student majoring in Space Science. Welcome to my [digital arboretum](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)! This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time.

*You might be wondering why there are penguins in an arboretum. Well, I don't know either xD This is just a strange combination of my favourite stuff lol*



## How to navigate

You can simply move from note to note by clicking on internal links on each page or on the nodes of the interactive graph on the right side if you're viewing on desktop (at the bottom for mobile). You can also use the search tool at the top (or **Ctrl + K**) to look for posts and keywords. Alternatively, you may look at a list of my [topics here](https://thdngan.github.io/quartz/subjects/ ):

- Some cool [[astrophysics|astrophysics]] stuff           ﾟ.+:｡∩(・ω・)∩ﾟ.+:｡
- Awesome [[climate n weather|Climate Modelling & Planetary Science]]           ﾟ+.ﾟ(\*´∀\`)bﾟ+.ﾟ
- [[image processing|Signal & Image Processing (just image for now lol)]]     (´ｰ｀).｡\*･ﾟﾟ
- or me babbling about [[particle physics|particle physics]]     ～(´∀｀～)

## Why this place?

I wrote blogs across a variety of platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[posts/neutrino communication|neutrino application]] and it soon hit me that it would be way more elegant and intriguing to explain the intricate world of neutrinos by utilizing these nifty bidirectional links to all those other particle physics concepts it's tangled up with. So I thought, "Why not publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes and utilize them for my blogs?"

I've had a lot of fun setting up my own garden (and a little headache because I'm new to all of this haha). Many thanks to Jacky Zhao for creating this incredible [tool](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)!
