## Definition

Clathrate hydrates are a fascinating class of chemical compounds. They are **crystalline structures** in which **gas molecules** are *trapped* within **cages** formed by water molecules. The most common type of clathrate hydrates involves water ice cages with gas molecules, typically methane, encased within them. However, other gases like carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and various hydrocarbons can also form clathrate hydrates under specific conditions.

In this paper:

- Deal almost exclusively with clathrate compounds for which water ice forms the lattice structure (i.e., the "**host**" molecule) -> the term ***clathrate*** is here understood to mean clathrate hydrate.
- The gas molecule occupying a cage site is the "**guest**" molecule. The term ***methane clathrate*** is used to denote a clathrate hydrate in which methane is the primary *guest* molecule.
- Occasional discussion of clathrates in which a substance other than water ice is the host, for example, quinol, will emply the term ***quinol clathrale***.
- A stoichiometric compound of water ice, in which molecules bond chemically with the water molecule and do not form a clathrate, will be denoted as a ***hydrate***, e.g., ammonia hydrate.



## Importance in outer solar system

- Volatiles like methane might be present on Titan, Triton, and potentially Pluto due to clathrates playing a role in their formation.
- Advanced observational methods have opened up the opportunity for the initial direct observation of clathrates on celestial bodies in the outer solar system.

## Introduction

- Extend a statistical mechanical model of clathrate formation originally developed by van der Waals and Platteeuw (1959) to predict the formation conditions and composition of clathrate hydrate under a wide range of situations of interest to solar system studies.
- ***Low pressure*** ($10^{-12}$ to 1 bar): regimes of gaseous nebulae, in which the outer planets and satellites may have formed.
- ***Intermediate pressure*** (1 to $10^2$ bars): present-day atmosphere of Titan and plausible models for primordial atmospheres.
- ***High pressure*** ($\gtrsim 10^3$ bars): interiors of large icy satellites.



Goal:
- Treat all of these cases with a **single, physically reasonable model** of clathrate formation which is **tied** as much as possible directly **to laboratory data** on the **stability** of the various clathrate compounds or the **thermodynamic properties** of the pure components themselves.
$\rightarrow$ Predict:
	- Conditions of formation of clathrate hydrate of CO, an important molecule cosmochemically and one for which no laboratory data on the clathrate yet exist.
	- Substantial double occupancy of clathrate cages by CH4 and H2, the latter by itself a poor clathrate hydrate former $\rightarrow$ implications for satellite outgassing processes.

- Deal with ***stability of clathrates at high pressure*** (>5 kilobars) and the ***formation of clathrates*** in the presence of an ***ammonia-water solution*** (a probable primordial environment in large icy satellites). (few or no data exist, dealt with for the first time)
- Analyze ***clathrate formation kinetics*** in a gaseous environment $\rightarrow$ find that disequilibrium is likely in many circumstances, including the formation conditions of comets, but that approach to full equilibrium may occur if ice particles or planetesimals undergo extensive collisional gardening. Approach to equilibrium is more probable in the higher-density, higher-temperature nebulae around proto-giant planets than in the primordial solar nebula.

## Literature review on clathrate properties & occurrence & previous applications to solar system problems

- Clathrate hydrate structure: open, cage-like voids, each formed by **20-28 hydrogen-bonded** water molecules.
- **==Two structural types==**: I and II. The ==size of the included guest molecule== determines which is formed.
	- **Structure I clathrate:** 2 small cages + 6 large cages.
	- **Structure II clathrate:** 16 small + 8 large (10% bigger radius than structure I large cages)
- Previously **assumed** that all molecules **smaller than 5.8 $\text{\r{A}}$** form structure I clathrate. **BUT** Davidson et al. (1984) demonstrate that **argon & krypton** preferentially form structure II clathrate, while somewhat larger molecules such as **CH4** form structure I.
- **==Pure==** clathrate:
	- Only 1 kind of guest molecule.
	- Characterized by:
		- **dissociation pressure**, defined empirically as the *minimum* gas pressure of the *guest* molecule at a given temperature for which the corresponding clathrate is stable.
		- **degree of occupancy**, defined as the fraction of available cage sites occupied by a guest molecule.
- **==Mixed==** clathrate:
	- More than 1 kind of guest molecule.

Calculate phase diagram of clathrate hydrate in the presence of ammonia at moderate pressures


## High-pressure equilibria

Use results from statistical model to calculate complete stability fields of both methane & molecular nitrogen clathrate hydrate (up to tens of kilobars of pressure). Although almost no laboratory data are available at these pressures, the regime is directly relevant to the interiors of large satellites such as Titan and Triton, and perhaps the planet Pluto.

## Applications
Apply the results of previous sections to calculate the abundance of volatiles incorporated in clathrate formed from a solar composition gas and explores implications for the current composition and evolution of satellites and giant-planet atmospheres.
