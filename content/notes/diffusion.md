If [[advection]] is the _big, dramatic highway system_ of fluid transport, then **diffusion** is more like a lazy afternoon where molecules just _wander around aimlessly_ until they spread out evenly. No currents, no winds—just pure, random motion.

Diffusion is essentially the process of molecules moving from a region of **higher concentration** to **lower concentration** until everything evens out. Imagine you open a bottle of perfume in a room—at first, the scent is strong near the bottle, but after a while, the fragrance spreads everywhere. That’s diffusion in action: molecules bouncing around randomly, gradually dispersing.

This happens **everywhere**—in the atmosphere, in your coffee, inside your own cells. It’s how oxygen spreads into your bloodstream, how heat equalizes in a room, and how ink spreads in water without you stirring it. Unlike **advection**, which relies on bulk movement (like wind or ocean currents), diffusion is a **slow, passive process** driven by molecular motion.

And the best part? Diffusion works at every scale—from **gas clouds in space** to **chemical reactions inside a single cell**. It’s the universe’s way of making sure nothing stays too concentrated in one spot for too long.
