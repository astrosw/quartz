Diffusion is a physical process where molecules or particles spread from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This movement continues until there is an equal concentration of molecules throughout the available space. Diffusion occurs in gases, liquids, and solids, though it is most commonly observed and studied in gases and liquids due to the more noticeable movement of particles.
