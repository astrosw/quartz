'_Δ_' -- means a change in some variable. This makes it a difference operation: _Δt = t2 - t1_.

'_d_' -- means an 'infinitesimal' change, or a "[differential form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form)." It's kind of like a limit as _Δt_ -> 0, but it is compatible with relative rates or different kinds of limits, so that the notion of a derivative is preserved (in the form dy/dx, for example.)

'_∂_' -- means a _partial_ differential. It's basically the same as _d_, except it also tells you that there are other related variables that are being held constant. In other words, it is never a complete picture. It's typically used in [partial derivatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative) -- derivatives that are only in one dimension of a larger dimensional space.

'_δ_' is just a lowercase _Δ_, and its meaning depends on context. Usually it means an 'infinitesimal' change like _d_, but when you don't want to talk about differential forms or derivatives using the other notations.
