Ocean worlds are celestial bodies in our solar system that are believed to have vast oceans beneath their surfaces. These oceans are typically composed of water, but may also contain other substances such as ammonia or methane, depending on the specific composition of the celestial body. These include moons of Jupiter like Europa or moons of Saturn like Enceladus, Titan. These ocean worlds are of significant interest to scientists because they offer the potential for habitable environments beyond Earth. Understanding the composition and dynamics of their subsurface oceans could provide insights into the origins of life in the universe and inform the search for extraterrestrial life.
