Albedo refers to the measure of the reflectivity of a surface. Specifically, it quantifies the fraction of incoming solar radiation (sunlight) that is reflected back into space. Albedo is typically expressed as a percentage or a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a perfectly absorbing (black) surface that absorbs all incoming solar radiation, and 1 represents a perfectly reflecting (white) surface that reflects all incoming solar radiation.

Changes in albedo can have various environmental consequences. For instance, the melting of polar ice caps reduces the Earth's overall albedo because darker ocean water replaces reflective ice and snow, leading to further warming in a positive feedback loop. Similarly, changes in land use, such as deforestation or urbanization, can alter the albedo of a region and affect local climate patterns.
