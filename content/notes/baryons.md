Baryons are the builders of the universe’s structure, and the reason atoms—and everything made of them—exist.%%  If fundamental particles were a cosmic family, baryons would be the strong, reliable ones holding everything together. %%

Baryons belong to the **[[hadrons|hadron family]]**, meaning they are [[composite particles]] made of [[quarks]]. More specifically, they are a type of hadron that consists of _three quarks_ bound together by the [[strong interactions|strong nuclear force]], mediated by [[gluons]]. The most famous baryons are the **[[protons|proton]]** and **[[neutrons|neutron]]**, which make up [[atomic nuclei]] and form the foundation of all matter. But they’re not alone—there’s a whole zoo of exotic baryons, like the **Lambda (Λ), Sigma (Σ), Xi (Ξ), and Omega (Ω) baryons**, which contain heavier [[quarks]] and are often found in high-energy particle collisions or inside neutron stars.

What makes baryons special is their **quark composition**. While [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] are built from “up” and “down” quarks (the lightest and most stable types), other baryons can include **strange, charm, bottom, or even top quarks**, making them much heavier and more unstable. These exotic baryons decay quickly into lighter particles, which is why we don’t see them in everyday life—but they play a huge role in particle physics experiments and extreme cosmic environments.

Baryons also follow a rule called the **Pauli exclusion principle**, which means no two identical baryons can occupy the same quantum state. This is why neutron stars, made almost entirely of neutrons, resist collapsing despite their immense gravity—quantum mechanics literally holds them up!

While baryons dominate the visible universe, there’s a mystery: most of the mass in the cosmos is _not_ baryonic. Dark matter, whatever it is, doesn’t seem to be made of baryons at all. So while protons and neutrons form everything we see—planets, stars, and life itself—something else, something invisible, outweighs them in the grand cosmic balance.

%% Still, baryons remain the backbone of the material world, proving that sometimes, the strongest forces come from things working together. %%
