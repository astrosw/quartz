%% Atoms are  the tiny, indestructible architects of everything—every star, every planet, every living thing, and even the screen you're reading this on. They’re the basic building blocks of matter, yet they’re  mostly _empty space_, with a dense, powerful [[atomic nuclei|nucleus]] at the center and a cloud of [[electrons]] buzzing around it like hyperactive fireflies.  Despite their minuscule size, atoms are the foundation of all chemistry, the reason elements exist, and the source of the universe’s stunning complexity.  %%

At the core of every atom is the **[[atomic nuclei|atomic nucleus]]**, packed with **[[protons]]** and **[[neutrons]]**. The number of [[protons]] determines the element. [[neutrons|Neutrons]] help stabilize the nucleus, and different numbers of them create **isotopes**, some of which are stable and some radioactive. Surrounding this nucleus is the **electron cloud**, a region where [[electrons]] zip around at near-light speeds, forming a probabilistic blur rather than neat orbits.%%  These electrons, held in place by their attraction to the positively charged nucleus, are responsible for all of chemistry—bonding atoms into molecules, shaping materials, and enabling life itself. %%

But atoms are far from static. Their [[electrons]] can jump between energy levels, absorb or emit light, and even get shared or stolen in chemical reactions. When atoms bond, they create the endless variety of substances that make up the physical world. And when atoms smash together in extreme environments—like inside stars—they undergo **nuclear fusion**, forging new elements and releasing the energy that powers the cosmos.

Atoms may seem eternal, but they have their limits. In the hearts of massive stars, they fuse into heavier elements until reaching iron, after which they collapse and explode in supernovae, scattering new atoms into space. Even now, the atoms in your body were once inside ancient stars, recycled through billions of years of cosmic evolution. ✨ We made of stardust! ✨

%% Despite their simplicity, atoms are the foundation of everything—tiny but mighty, invisible yet essential, shaping the universe one interaction at a time. %%
