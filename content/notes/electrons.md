Small but mighty, electrons are the wild, high-energy performers of the subatomic world, zipping around atoms and making modern life possible.

Electrons belong to a special group of particles called [[leptons]], which are fundamental, meaning they’re not made of anything smaller. Leptons are like the free-spirited, independent crowd of the particle zoo, and electrons are the most famous of them all. Unlike [[quarks]], which stick together to form protons and neutrons, electrons do their own thing, orbiting [[atomic nuclei]] and refusing to be tied down.

What makes electrons so special? For one, they carry a negative electric charge, which means they interact with *photons* (the [[bosons]] of electromagnetism), making electricity, magnetism, and all sorts of tech magic happen. Every time you flip a light switch, send a text, or zap popcorn in a microwave, electrons are the ones putting in the work.

And here’s a fun twist—electrons aren't just particles; they also behave like waves. In the quantum world, they can be in multiple places at once, interfere with themselves, and even teleport (sort of) through quantum tunneling. They're unpredictable, energetic, and impossible to pin down, yet they make up a crucial part of atoms, chemistry, and life itself.
