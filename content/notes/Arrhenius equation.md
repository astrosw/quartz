Temperature dependence of reaction rates:

$$
k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}
$$
where:
- $k$: rate constant (frequency of collisions resulting in a reaction),
- $A$: pre-exponential factor/Arrhenius factor/frequency factor,
- $E_a$: molar activation energy for the reaction,
- $R$: universal gas constant,
- $T$: absolute temperature.

$$
\rightarrow \ln k = \ln A - \frac{E_a}{R}\cdot \frac{1}{T}
$$
