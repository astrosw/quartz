Atomic nuclei are the beating hearts of atoms, tiny powerhouses where nearly all of an atom’s mass resides. %% If atoms were solar systems, the nucleus would be the massive sun at the center, holding everything together with an invisible but unstoppable force.  %%Despite being just a fraction of an atom’s total size, nuclei are dense beyond imagination—if you could compress a chunk of matter to nuclear density, a sugar-cube-sized piece would weigh about a billion tons!

The atomic nucleus is made up of **[[protons]] and [[neutrons]]**, collectively called **nucleons**. The number of [[protons]] determines the element (one for hydrogen, two for helium, six for carbon, and so on), while the number of [[neutrons]] can vary, creating **isotopes** of the same element. Protons, being positively charged, should repel each other—but they don’t, thanks to the **[[strong interactions|strong nuclear force]]**, which is a lot stronger than electromagnetism at short distances. This force, carried by **[[gluons]]** and mediated by **[[pions]]**, glues [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] together, and overpower their natural repulsion, making stable nuclei possible.

But not all nuclei are stable. Some are **radioactive**, meaning they slowly decay into other elements by emitting particles like alpha particles (helium nuclei), beta particles ([[electrons]] or [[positrons]]), or gamma radiation (high-energy [[photons]]). This process is what fuels nuclear reactors, powers the heat of the Earth’s core, and even provides the radioactive dating methods used to determine the age of ancient fossils and rocks.

At the extreme end of the scale, the nucleus is also the engine behind the most powerful forces in the universe. **Nuclear fusion**, which powers stars, occurs when small nuclei smash together to form heavier ones, releasing immense amounts of energy. **Nuclear fission**, where large nuclei split apart, is the process behind nuclear reactors and atomic bombs. In both cases, a tiny amount of mass is converted into energy, as described by Einstein’s famous equation, _E = mc²_.

Despite all we know, atomic nuclei still hold mysteries. The exact behavior of the [[strong interactions|strong force]] inside large nuclei is complex and not fully understood, and researchers are still searching for the limits of nuclear stability—how big a nucleus can get before it simply falls apart.

But one thing is clear: without atomic nuclei, there would be no atoms, no chemistry, and no matter as we know it. They are the cosmic glue holding everything together, tiny but mighty, shaping the universe from the inside out. %%
