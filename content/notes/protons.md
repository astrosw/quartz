Protons are sturdy, positively charged particles that sit at the heart of every atom, defining the very elements that make up matter. %% They’re not just ordinary subatomic particles; they’re the reason chemistry, biology, and everything else in the material world exist. Without protons, there would be no atoms, no molecules, and no life. %%

Protons belong to the **[[baryons|baryon family]]**, meaning they’re made of **three [[quarks]]** held together by the [[strong interactions|strong nuclear force]]. Specifically, a proton is composed of **two up quarks and one down quark** (uud), bound so tightly by [[gluons]] that they can never escape. This internal structure makes protons incredibly stable, and unlike [[neutrons]], which can decay outside a nucleus, protons seem to last _forever_—at least, as far as we know. Some theories predict that protons _might_ eventually decay after an absurdly long time (longer than the age of the universe!), but so far, they appear to be immortal.

Being **positively charged**, protons play a crucial role in determining an atom’s identity. The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is what defines an element—one proton makes hydrogen, two make helium, six make carbon, and so on. %% Electrons may govern chemistry, but protons are what set the stage, deciding which elements exist in the first place. %%

%% Protons are also key players in nuclear reactions.  %%In the Sun, hydrogen nuclei (which are just single protons) smash together in nuclear fusion, creating helium and releasing the energy that powers our solar system. In particle accelerators, high-energy proton collisions help us uncover new physics, from [[quarks]] to exotic particles.

Despite their everyday presence, protons still hold mysteries. Their precise size is the subject of ongoing debate (the “proton radius puzzle”), and their deep internal structure is far more complex than just three [[quarks]] sitting inside. Instead, they’re a swirling sea of [[quarks]], antiquarks, and [[gluons]], constantly shifting in a dance dictated by quantum chromodynamics.

%% At their core, protons are the backbone of matter—stable, essential, and packed with the forces that make the universe work. They may be small, but their impact is anything but. %%
