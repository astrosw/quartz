In thermodynamics, free energy refers to the portion of a system's energy that is available to perform work at a constant temperature and pressure. It is a thermodynamic potential that helps predict the direction of chemical processes and the equilibrium position of reactions. There are two primary types of free energy: Gibbs free energy (G) and Helmholtz free energy (A).
