- escaping tendency
- (of a real gas) an effective partial pressure replacing the mechanical partial pressure in an accurate computation of chemical equilibrium.
- a measure of the chemical potential $\rightarrow$ net transfer of the chemical from higher fugacity compartment to lower fugacity compartment until fugacities are equal $\rightarrow$ net transfer = 0 $\rightarrow$ equilibrium.
