Muons are like [[electrons]]’ heavier, short-lived cousins, belonging to the same family of fundamental particles known as [[leptons]]. They carry the same negative charge and behave almost identically to [[electrons]], but there’s a catch—they’re over 200 times **more massive**! This extra bulk makes them **unstable**, and unlike [[electrons]], which stick around indefinitely as part of atoms, muons decay in just a few microseconds into lighter particles, usually an electron and a pair of neutrinos.

Despite their fleeting existence, muons leave a big impact. They rain down on us constantly from *cosmic rays*—high-energy particles from space smashing into Earth's atmosphere. In fact, right now, muons are passing through your body at nearly the speed of light, completely harmless but always present. Their ability to penetrate deep into matter makes them useful for imaging dense structures, from ancient pyramids to nuclear reactors.

Muons also played a key role in testing Einstein’s theory of relativity. Since they decay quickly, most of them shouldn’t survive the journey from the upper atmosphere to the ground. But thanks to time dilation—where time slows down for fast-moving objects—muons last long enough to reach us, proving that the strange effects of relativity are very real.

So while they may not stick around for long, muons are cosmic messengers, revealing the hidden nature of the universe in every fleeting moment they exist.
