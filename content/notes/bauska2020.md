- explain millennial & centennial events

- focus on 1st figure?

- 2nd figure: maybe additional scheme of box experiments if there is.

- 3rd figure just brief

## Scientific question

How atmospheric CO2 varied during the last glacial period and the processes driving these variations.
 - To clarify the relationship between centennial- and millennial-scale CO2 variability, Antarctic climate, and abrupt Northern Hemisphere climate events like Heinrich stadials and Dansgaardâ€“Oeschger (DO) events.

## Terms
- Millennial-scale variations:
