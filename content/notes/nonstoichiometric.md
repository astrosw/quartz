Nonstoichiometric refers to a characteristic of a compound where the proportions of elements do not match simple whole-number ratios, deviating from the stoichiometric ratios expected from their chemical formula. Nonstoichiometric compounds often occur in solid-state chemistry, particularly in materials such as metal oxides, sulfides, and other inorganic compounds. These compounds have a variable composition due to the presence of defects or the accommodation of additional atoms or ions in their crystal structures.
