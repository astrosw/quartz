%% If axioms exist, they could explain both a deep mystery in quantum mechanics _and_ the nature of dark matter, making them one of the most sought-after particles in the universe. %%

Axions were first proposed to solve the **strong CP problem** in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In simple terms, QCD—the theory describing the [[strong interactions|strong nuclear force]]—should allow for a strange kind of symmetry violation (charge-parity violation) in the interactions of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]]. But in reality, we don’t see this happening, and nobody knows why. Enter axions: these **hypothetical** particles could naturally “cancel out” this effect, explaining why the [[strong interactions|strong interaction]] behaves the way it does without breaking symmetry where it shouldn’t.

But axions might not just be a neat mathematical fix—they could also be the long-sought answer to **dark matter**. Unlike ordinary matter, dark matter doesn’t interact via electromagnetism, meaning it doesn’t emit, absorb, or reflect light. It only reveals itself through [[gravity]], shaping galaxies and cosmic structures. Axions, if they exist, would be extremely light, barely interacting with other particles, and could form an enormous, invisible field filling the universe—precisely the kind of thing dark matter needs to be.

Unlike most particles in the Standard Model, axions are predicted to be **neutral, extremely light, and incredibly [[weak interactions|weakly interacting]]**. This makes them almost impossible to detect directly, but researchers are trying. Experiments like ADMX (Axion Dark Matter Experiment) are searching for axions by looking for their potential interactions with electromagnetic fields, hoping to finally catch these ghostly particles in action.

%% If axions are discovered, they could revolutionize our understanding of both particle physics and cosmology, solving two of the biggest mysteries in science at once. Until then, they remain theoretical phantoms—whispered about in equations, suspected in the cosmos, but still waiting to reveal themselves. %%
