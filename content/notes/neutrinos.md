%% Neutrinos are [[fermions]] that only interact through [[notes/weak interactions|weak interactions]] and [[notes/gravity|gravity]].

They are electrically neutral and have very small rest mass.

### Where are neutrinos?

Although neutrinos are member of fermions, they cannot join the constitution of matter. They can interact only weakly and cannot be captured with other particles.

Neutrinos are the universe’s ultimate ninjas—silent, nearly invisible, and absurdly fast. They barely interact with anything, passing through planets, stars, and even you by the trillions every second without a trace. *(wannabe poet/writer incoming)* If [[photons]] are the bright, energetic extroverts of the particle world, neutrinos are the mysterious wanderers, slipping through reality almost unnoticed.

Neutrinos belong to the [[leptons|lepton family]], the same group as [[electrons]] and [[muons]], but unlike their charged cousins, neutrinos have no electric charge. This means they don’t feel the electromagnetic force at all. They only interact via the [[weak interactions|weak nuclear force]] and [[gravity]] (though their mass is so tiny, [[gravity]] barely notices them). Because of this, they can travel cosmic distances without being stopped, making them messengers from the most extreme places in the universe—supernovae, black hole collisions, and even the Big Bang itself.

But neutrinos aren’t just one type—they come in **three known flavors**:

- **Electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$)** – produced in nuclear reactions, like those in the Sun.
- **Muon neutrinos ($\nu_\mu$)** – created in high-energy cosmic ray collisions.
- **Tau neutrinos ($\nu_\tau$)** – linked to the heavier tau particle, the rarest and hardest to detect.

And here’s where things get even weirder: neutrinos can actually _change_ from one type to another as they travel, a phenomenon called **neutrino oscillation**. This was a groundbreaking discovery because it proved that neutrinos _must_ have mass—something the original Standard Model of physics didn’t predict.

Despite being nearly undetectable, neutrinos may hold the key to some of the biggest mysteries in physics. Do they explain why the universe has more matter than antimatter? Could there be a fourth “sterile” neutrino, one that doesn’t interact even via the weak force? We don’t know yet, but one thing is certain—neutrinos are some of the strangest, most elusive, and most fascinating particles in the cosmos.
