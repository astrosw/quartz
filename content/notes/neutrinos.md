Neutrinos are [fermions](https://astrosw.github.io/quartz/particle-physics/fermions) that only interact through [[notes/weak interactions|weak interactions]] and [[notes/gravity|gravity]].

They are electrically neutral and have very small rest mass.

### Where are neutrinos?

Although neutrinos are member of fermions, they cannot join the constitution of matter. They can interact only weakly and cannot be captured with other particles.
