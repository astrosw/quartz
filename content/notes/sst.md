# Reading netCDF files

%% The code below is used to work with netCDF files and extract data from them. First, I imported the required libraries, netCDF4 and Dataset, from the netCDF4 module. The code opens a netCDF file named 'sst.mnmean.nc' using the Dataset class from the netCDF4 library. It then prints the file format, dimension information, variable information and attributes.

 The code extracts specific variables from the netCDF file. It uses fh.variables\['variable\_name'\]\[:\] to extract the data. In this case, it extracts latitude (lats), longitude (lons), time (time), sea surface temperature (sst), and their corresponding units (sst\_units).

 Next, it defines latitude and longitude index ranges for the NINO3 and NINO3.4 regions. It selects the relevant data from the sst variable based on these index ranges to calculate the sea surface temperature for the NINO3 region (sst\_3) and the NINO3.4 region (sst\_34). %%

```python
import math
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
import pandas as pd
import netCDF4 as nc
from netCDF4 import Dataset
# open a netcdf file
file='sst.mnmean.nc'
fh = Dataset(file, 'r') # Dataset is the class behavior to open the netCDF file

# fh means the file handle of the open netCDF file
# print fh format
print(fh.file_format)

# # print info about dimensions
print(fh.dimensions.keys())
print(fh.dimensions['time'])

# print info about variables
print(fh.variables.keys())

# print attributes
print(fh.Conventions)

for attr in fh.ncattrs():
    print(attr, '=',getattr(fh,attr))
    
# Extract fh from NetCDF file
lats = fh.variables['lat'][:] # extract/copy the fh
lons = fh.variables['lon'][:]
time = fh.variables['time'][:]
d_times=nc.num2date(fh.variables['time'][:],fh.variables['time'].units)
sst = fh.variables['sst'][:] # shape is time, lat, lon as shown above
sst_units=fh.variables['sst'].units

d_times=nc.num2date(fh.variables['time'][:],fh.variables['time'].units)

# Calulate NINO index, & plot the results
latidx_nino3 = (lats >=-5. ) & (lats <=5. )
lonidx_nino3 = (lons >=210. ) & (lons <=270. )
latidx_nino34 = (lats >=-5. ) & (lats <=5. )
lonidx_nino34 = (lons >=190. ) & (lons <=240. )
sst_3 = sst [:, latidx_nino3][..., lonidx_nino3]
sst_34 = sst [:, latidx_nino34][..., lonidx_nino34]

%% Next, I performed further analysis and generated a plot to visualize the Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA) over the Nino3 and Nino3.4 regions.

The code converts the extracted d\_times (previously obtained as num2date) to a more readable format. It iterates over each d\_times value and converts it to a string in the format 'YYYY/MM/DD' using string concatenation. Then, it uses datetime.strptime() to parse the string into a datetime object and appends it to the times list.

Then I calculated the Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA) for the Nino3 and Nino3.4 regions. I computed the mean of sst\_3 over the latitude and longitude axes using np.mean(sst\_3, axis=(1, 2)). Similarly, I calculated the mean of sst\_34 over the latitude and longitude axes. Then, I subtracted the mean of sst\_3 from the calculated mean to obtain the NINO3 SSTA (nino3). Similarly, these steps can obtain the NINO3.4 SSTA (nino34). %%

Some further analysis and generated a plot to visualize the Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA) over the Nino3 and Nino3.4 regions:

```python
from datetime import datetime
times = []
for i in d_times:
    d = str(i.year) + '/' + str(i.month) + '/' + str(i.day)
    i = datetime.strptime(d,'%Y/%m/%d')
    # print(i)
    times.append(i)
```

```python
#to get the mean values over lon/lat axis
nino3= np.mean(sst_3,axis=(1,2))-np.mean(sst_3)
nino34= np.mean(sst_34,axis=(1,2))-np.mean(sst_34)
plt.figure(1,figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(times,nino3, color = "goldenrod", linewidth = 2, label = "Nin$o 3")
plt.plot(times,nino34, color = "maroon", linewidth = 3, label = "Nino 3.4")
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (oC)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left', prop = {'size':10})
plt.title('SSTA over Nino3 and Nino3.4')
```

The difference in how much temperatures fluctuate between the Nino 3 and Nino 3.4 regions comes down to their locations and the unique oceanic processes at play in each area. While both are key players in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), they experience different levels of variability due to their positioning in the Pacific.

- **Nino 3 Region**: This stretch of ocean sits between **5°S and 5°N latitude** and **210° to 270° longitude**, placing it in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. It’s a hotspot for dramatic temperature swings linked to ENSO. When El Niño kicks in, this area sees intense warming, and during La Niña, it cools significantly. That’s because it’s right in the thick of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions that drive ENSO’s strongest effects.
    
- **Nino 3.4 Region**: Covering **5°S to 5°N latitude** and **190° to 240° longitude**, Nino 3.4 sits slightly farther east but still overlaps with the central Pacific. It straddles the boundary where warm waters from El Niño start to fade and where the eastern Pacific’s cooler upwelling processes begin.
    

The big reason Nino 3 experiences more extreme fluctuations than Nino 3.4 lies in ocean dynamics. Nino 3 sits in a region where ENSO-related heat exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere are more pronounced, creating stronger temperature anomalies. Meanwhile, Nino 3.4, positioned closer to the eastern Pacific, has a **shallower thermocline**—meaning warm surface waters don’t mix as deeply with the colder layers below. As a result, temperature swings in Nino 3.4 tend to be more moderate compared to the wilder fluctuations seen in Nino 3.
%% 
In short, while both regions play an important role in ENSO, Nino 3 is the more volatile sibling, while Nino 3.4 is a bit more stable thanks to its eastern Pacific positioning and oceanic structure. %%

# Plotting average SST over the oceans

```python
sst_avg = np.mean(sst,axis=0)

# land-sea mask 
mask = Dataset('lsmask.nc', 'r').variables['mask'][:]
mask = mask.astype(float)
mask[mask == 0] = np.nan
#Let mask be the land-sea mask, we need to let the zero values be np.nan .

lon_2d, lat_2d = np.meshgrid(lons,lats)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,8))
# Create a contour plot
plt.contourf(lon_2d, lat_2d, sst_avg*mask[0],levels=24,linewidths = 1, vmin = sst_avg.min(),vmax=sst_avg.max(), cmap = 'RdYlBu_r')

# Add colorbar and labels
plt.colorbar(label='Sea Surface Temperature (degC)')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.title('Average Sea Surface Temperature',fontsize=24)
plt.gca().set_facecolor("silver")
plt.savefig('08_average_SST.png',dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

If you take a look at the figure, you’ll notice a clear trend: sea surface temperatures (SST) are toasty near the equator and much cooler as you move toward the poles. This pattern isn’t random—it’s all about **radiative heating**, the process where the Sun’s energy gets absorbed by the Earth’s surface, including the ocean, and turned into heat.

In the tropics, especially in places like the equatorial Pacific, the Sun’s rays hit more directly, delivering a concentrated dose of energy. This means the ocean absorbs more heat, keeping SSTs warm year-round. But up near the poles, the Sun’s rays strike at a lower angle, spreading out that energy over a larger area. That, combined with long, dark winters, results in much lower radiative heating—hence, colder ocean temperatures.
%% 
So, in short, **the closer to the equator, the hotter the ocean; the closer to the poles, the chillier it gets**—all thanks to the way sunlight interacts with our planet! %%

# Plotting SST departures

I performed the following operations to calculate and visualize the departure of local Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the zonal average field. %% The code calculates the zonal average of the SST by taking the mean along the longitude axis using np.mean(sst, axis=2). This produces an array with dimensions of time and latitude, representing the average SST across each latitude band. To match the shape of the original SST array, the zonal average array (sst\_zonal\_avg) is expanded along the longitude axis using np.expand\_dims() and then repeated 360 times using np.repeat().

I then subtracted the expanded zonal average field (sst\_zonal\_avg\_expanded) from the original SST field (sst) to obtain the departure of local SST from the zonal average field. This calculates the deviation of each SST value from the corresponding zonal average value. The resulting array is stored in sst\_departure.

Next, I computed the mean of the departure array along the time axis using np.mean(sst\_departure, axis=0). This yields an array representing the average deviation of local SST from the zonal average across all time steps. %%

```python
# Compute the zonal average SST
sst_zonal_avg = np.mean(sst, axis=2)

# Expand the zonal average array along the longitude axis to match the original SST shape
sst_zonal_avg_expanded = np.expand_dims(sst_zonal_avg, axis=2)
sst_zonal_avg_expanded = np.repeat(sst_zonal_avg_expanded, 360, axis=2)

# Calculate the departure of the local SST from the zonal average field
sst_departure = sst - sst_zonal_avg_expanded

# Calculate the mean of departure
sst_departure_avg = np.mean(sst_departure,axis=0)

cm = plt.cm.get_cmap('RdYlBu_r')
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,8))
# Create a contour plot
plt.contourf(lon_2d, lat_2d, (sst_departure_avg)*mask[0],levels=24,linewidths = 1,vmin=sst_departure_avg.min()+3,vmax=sst_departure_avg.max()-1, cmap = cm)

# Add colorbar and labels
plt.colorbar(label='Departure of local SST from zonal average field (degC)')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.title('Sea Surface Temperature Departure',fontsize=24)
plt.gca().set_facecolor("darkgrey")
plt.savefig('08_SST_departure.png',dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

SST departure is just a fancy way of saying how much the local sea surface temperature (SST) differs from the average temperature across a given latitude. These deviations aren’t random—they’re shaped by a mix of atmospheric and oceanic circulations that move heat around in complex ways.

In the **subtropics**, the eastern parts of ocean basins tend to be cooler. That’s because air flowing along the eastern edges of high-pressure systems (anticyclones) moves toward the equator, bringing cooler temperatures along with it. This cooling effect is especially noticeable in the eastern Pacific. On the flip side, the western edges of these high-pressure systems push warm, moist air toward the poles, leading to warmer SST departures in the **western Pacific**.

Up in the **higher latitudes**, things get chillier due to sub-polar cyclones. These weather systems create a poleward flow of cool air, reinforcing lower SST departures in these regions.
 
Meanwhile, along the **equator**, there’s another big player: **wind-driven upwelling**. The trade winds sweep warm surface waters away from the equator, allowing deeper, colder, nutrient-rich water to rise up and replace it. This process is why the **equatorial eastern Pacific and Atlantic** tend to have lower SST departures.

%% These dynamical factors influence the spatial variations in SST departures, highlighting regions where the local SST significantly deviates from the zonal average. The combination of equatorward/ poleward air flows, wind-driven upwelling, and atmospheric circulations shape the observed SST departure patterns across different latitudes. %%
