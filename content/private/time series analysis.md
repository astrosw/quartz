- **Time series data (time-stamped data):** a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time. It is a sequence of data points indexed in time order.
- **Time series analysis**: statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series analysis means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals.


- Data Preparation:
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Trend, Seasonality
- Test stationarity
- Data Transformation: Moving average, Exponential smoothing
- Review SARIMA with ACF and PACF: Autoregressive (p), Integrated (d), moving average (q)

**Why does Stationarity matter?**
- Most time series models assume that each point is independent of one another
- The statistical properties of the data should not change over time.
- Stationarity helps us better identify the driving factors.
