# About L'arboretum

Welcome to my [digital arboretum](https://thdngan.github.io/arboretum/)!

This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, notebooks, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as #incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time.

I discovered [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) while searching for a way to publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes on a [neutrino communication|neutrino application](https://thdngan.github.io/arboretum/posts/neutrino-communication). I've had so much fun setting up my own garden, *and a little \*coughs\* headache because I was truly a noob at front-end stuff lol*. The results are really worth it though, and I picked up a ton of knowledge along the way. Many thanks to [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0) for creating this incredible tool!
