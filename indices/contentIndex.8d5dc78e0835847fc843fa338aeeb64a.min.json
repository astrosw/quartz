This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time. In contrast to a blog, the contents aren't precisely arranged by the date they were published, and the [[my topics|topics]] layout is a reflection of my own preferences and way of thinking.\n\n## Why this place?\n\nI wrote blogs across a variety of platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[posts/neutrino communication|neutrino application]] and soon realized that the neutrino concept would be simpler to grasp using bidirectional links due to its interconnection with so many other particle physics concepts. So I thought, \"Why not publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes and utilize them for my blogs?\"\n\nI've had a lot of fun setting up my own garden (and a little headache because I'm new to all of this haha). Many thanks to [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) for creating this incredible tool!\n\n## How to navigate\n\nThe best part about this digital garden is that you can simply move from note to note by clicking on internal links on each page or on the nodes of the interactive graph at the bottom. You can also use the search tool at the top to look for pages and keywords.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T15:55:08.216785767Z","tags":null},"/my-topics":{"title":"My topics","content":"1.

You can't feel individual atoms, though, it is the huge collections of atoms that you feel. And yet, how that atom is jiggling, you can feel that instantly, because if you touch it, the fast jiggling of the atoms will bump up against the atoms of your skin and make those jiggle more quickly too. And if they jiggle too quickly, they can actually rip apart the chemical bonds of your skin and that's how you burn yourself, and that's why we have evolved to be able to sense how fast the atoms are wiggling around. So it's like we have little atomic speedometers in our fingertips.\n\nSo it turns out that each mode of motion of the atoms contains on average 1/2 KT of energy. So this is actually how the temperature is defined. This T is the temperature. K is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nSo if you have a gas that consists of single atoms.

Please let me know if you notice any mistakes or omissions.*\n\nIn this post, I'll discuss the possibility of using [[notes/neutrinos|neutrinos]] for communication between New York and Tokyo and answer the questions: What can we gain with neutrino-based communication in comparison to the conventional communications? What's the most challenging for developing this kind of communication?\n\nOf course in order to discuss all that, we need to grasp the basic concepts. The first question is undoubtedly:\n\n## What are neutrinos?\n\nBasically they are elementary particles that have neutral charge and very VERY small mass (thought to be massless for a long time). They are [[notes/fermions|fermions]] that interact only via the [[notes/weak interactions|weak interactions]] and [[notes/gravity|gravity]].\n\n*Well, I do realize the above explanation is still a little vague for those who are unfamiliar with particle physics (like me). Like okay, they're fermions, but what are fermions? What exactly are elementary particles? Where do they exist in atoms, and how do they connect with other particles that we are more familiar with, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons? And so i decided to set up this site to utiliize the power of bidirectional links. You can move to the individual notes of each concept by clicking on the internal links, or you can look at how these are connected in the interactive graph at the bottom.*\n\n## Why neutrinos for communication?\n\nNeutrinos can essentially travel through anything and everything. They can propagate through vast cosmic distances without significant attenuation or deflection. This is because they have relatively weak interactions and can't be caught by other particles. This capability makes neutrino a potential messenger for future global point-to-point communication, communication with submarines, interstellar communication or even planetary exploration! Isn't that exciting?\n\n*Neutrinos are often described as tiny particles or as having weak interactions. These phrases might a little bit confusing, though. \"Probability of interaction is small\" or \"neutrino interaction is rare\" are more suitable expressions to explain their penetrating characteristic.*\n\n*The concept of cross section would be helpful in comprehending this rarity. Cross section (σ(cm\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e) is the size of the target particle from a view point of interaction. For example, if 1 GeV protons interact with the target nuclei, the interaction is a hadron interaction with a cross section of σ ~ 3 x 10\u003csup\u003e-26\u003c/sup\u003e cm\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e. On the other hand, if 1 GeV neutrinos encounter the target nuclei, the interaction is weak, with a cross section of about σ ~ 1 x 10\u003csup\u003e-38\u003c/sup\u003e cm\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e. It is smaller than that of hadron interaction by a factor of 3 x 10\u003csup\u003e12\u003c/sup\u003e.*\n\n## Comparison to conventional communications\n\nc\n\n\n## Operation and Challenges\n\n### A past experiment\n\nNeutrino-based communication is thus an intriguing concept, but is it realistic?\n\nWeak interactions seem to provide neutrinos the benefit of penetrating matter, but this same property also suggests that very powerful beams and HUGE massive detectors would be required. These are regarded as the two major obstacles to implementing this kind of communication.\n\nAn [experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2847) had been conducted in 2012 using the NuMI beam line and the MINERvA detector to perform low-rate communications over a distance of about 1 km. \n\n### Path length and matter effect\n\nIn our scenario, however, we wish to send information from New York to Tokyo across the earth at a distance of about 9600 km. There have been concerns about whether the huge traveling distance might weaken the beam because it is very large in comparison to the experiment.\n\nThere are several ways to answer this.\n\nYou can use the following formula to calculate the number of particles left (N) after traveling a distance (x):\n\n \n\nwhere N\u003csub\u003e0\u003c/sub\u003e is the initial number of particles, σ is the interaction cross section and ρ is the density of matter which the particle pass through.\n\nSo when the particle is a neutrino, we all know that the cross section is very small, about 10\u003csup\u003e-38\u003c/sup\u003e cm\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e/GeV. For the density, we can take the standard density of rock, which is 2.65 g/cm\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e, and x would be 9600km. So the reduction should be really really small, even if the path length is very long and the neutrino energy is very high.\n\nWe can use another method to tackle this problem. Let's have a look at the plot below\n\n![[images/particle physics/maxmeier.jpg]]\n\nThis is a plot that shows the neutrino attenuation during propagation through the Earth. The x-axis is the zenith angle. The left y-axis shows the survival probability of a neutrino, and the right y-axis shows the slant depth in meters of water equivalent that the neutrino at that zenith angle would be passing through. So for our problem, we have 9600km, if we take the standard density of rock of 2.65 g/cm\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e, then 9600km of rock would correspond to approximately 26000km of water equivalent. So according to this plot, going from New York to Tokyo would correspond to a zenith angle of 110\u003csup\u003eo\u003c/sup\u003e. For a 120 GeV beam, for example, we should expect almost no neutrino attenuation. Of course this is just rough estimation.\n\nWe can also calculate the neutrino survival probability by ourselves using this formula:\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003eP\u003csub\u003esurv\u003c/sub\u003e=e\u003csup\u003e-N\u003csub\u003eA\u003c/sub\u003eσ\u003csub\u003eE\u003csub\u003enu\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/sub\u003eX\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nwhere N\u003csub\u003eA\u003c/sub\u003e is the Avogadro constant, σ\u003csub\u003eE\u003csub\u003enu\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/sub\u003e is the total neutrino cross sectrion at energy E\u003csub\u003enu\u003c/sub\u003e, and X is the slant depth in meters water equivalent. To calculate the slant depth you can use a density model of the Earth like [this](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PREM).\n\nRegarding the neutrino oscillations, at ~100 GeV energies neutrino oscillations can change the flavour of our neutrino beam. But most likely our neutrino detector will be able to detect all neutrino flavours. So if the idea of communication is similar to the past experiment using NuMI beam line and MINERvA detector (encoding communication bits by the neutrino beam being either on or off), I think the flavour composition of the neutrino beam should not be relevant.\n\nThere is another approach to the flavour change problem. When a mu-neutrino oscillates to a tau-neutrino and the energy is less than tau production threshold, charged current (CC) interactions never happen. In this case, the neutrino oscillation affects the detection. However the energy that was used (and will be used) is higher enough than the tau production threshold. (I think the interaction cross sections nu-e, nu-mu, and nu-tau can be assumed to be the same; neutral current (NC) cross sections are always the same for nu-e, nu-mu and nu-tau).\n\n### Beam intensity\n\nnumi\n\n### Detector\n\nminerva\n\n## Conclusion","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T15:55:08.216785767Z","tags":null},"/posts/sampling-and-quantization":{"title":"Sampling and Quantization in Image Processing","content":"*Images mentioned in this post are from Digital Image Processing (3rd edition), by Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods. I don't have the permission to use them here.*\n\nImages that we are familiar with represent a very small portion of the spectrum of images that can be acquired at various wavelengths and modalities _(Figure 2.10)_. In this post, I'll talk about the two most common image formats: grayscale and RGB.\n\nThere are two discretization processes in image processing: sampling (spatial discretization) and quantization (amplitude discretization). _Figures 2.16 and 2.17._\n\n-   Sampling: The sampling rate determines the spatial resolution of the image (related to coordinate values).\n\n-   Quantization: The quantization level specifies the image's grayscale range (related to intensity values).\n\nBasically, we begin with a continuous object and end up with a discrete object that has discretization in both the spatial domain and the gray value range. A good digital camera should have a dense enough sampling rate and a fine enough level of quantization to produce images that appear continuous but are actually discrete.\n\n## Grayscale images\n\nEach of the squares in _Figure 2.17 (b)_ represents a picture element, denoted by the term _pixel_. A 256x256 spatial domain image, for example, has 256 x 256 = 65,536 pixels, whereas a 1024x1280 image has 1,310,720 pixels. The value of each pixel in grayscale images is related to the amount of bits of data used to represent the pixel (typically 8 bits), ranging from 0 to 255 (28 = 256 grayscale levels created from combinations of 8 binary numbers: 00000000 to 11111111). If a pixel's value is represented by 16 bits, the value range is 0 to 65,535 (216 = 65,536 grayscale levels). We can have higher quality images, for instance, 512x512 images instead of 256x256 images with the same number of letters, so it will take more memory to save that image, but it will also have better quality.\n\nIn grayscale images, the value of each pixel only represents the intensity of light, which ranges from the darkest black to the brightest white. RGB images, which have colors, are another popular image format.\n\n## RGB images\n\nA colored image is made up of many colors, almost all of which can be generated from the three primary colors - red, green, and blue - and combined in various ways to display a wide range of colors. Each RGB image is made up of these three colors, as the name implies (or channels). This means that a colored image has more matrices (or channels).\n\nTo represent the intensity (shades of red, green, and blue) in a pixel, each of the small squares would have values ranging from 0 to 255. Then, all of these matrices (channels) are superimposed so that the final image has the value NxMx3, where N and M are the number of rows and columns, respectively, and 3 represents the number of channels. For example, if each matrix has 6 rows and 5 columns, the image value is 6x5x3.\n\nMost high-end cameras capture full 2-dimensional rays for each color, whereas most low-end to mid-end consumer cameras do something slightly different called mosaic. The basic idea is to capture the pixels with color interleaving (I'll go over this in more detail in another post).\n\n## Videos\n\nSo the next question is, what happens in a video? We have a number of these RGB images. For example, in some formats, we can have 30 x (RGB) for 1 second of video, with each RGB being a 2-dimensional structure. This translates to 30 x 3 = 90 images, with 30 images in 1 second and 3 because there are three color channels. If these images have a resolution of 512x512 and each pixel is represented by 8 bits, we can sometimes say that our resolution is 8 x 3 = 24 bits (3 times because of RGB). We'll see basically 2-dimensional discrete arrays as many seconds or frames as we have in our video using a program that knows how to deal with images. Each of these 30 images is referred to as a frame, and there are 30 frames in a second.\n\n## The Importance and Effects of Resolution in Space and in Gray values\n\n_How many pixels should we have? And what are the gray values we're going to use for them?_\n\nWhen we have 8 bits, 0 represents black and 255 represents white. When discussing the interval between 0 and 1, 255 is sometimes referred to as 1. While we see the black-white-gray image with our eyes, the computer reads it as a string of 0s for the black region, 128 or 0.5 for the grayscale region, and 1 for the white part. _Figure 2.18._\n\nSaturation is one of the potential issues. For instance, because we only have 256 different levels to work with, the image may be too bright and we may be unable to detect small variations in brightness. Remember that the human visual system can adapt to multiple levels of brightness, but not all of them simultaneously - the same is true for images. We can capture many levels (for example, 256), but dealing with a very dark and a very bright region at the same time would be difficult. _Figure 2.19._\n\nSo, we have a discrete number of values to represent our image, and some parts may go above and beyond what we can represent with that number.\n\nNow let's look at the effects in the images below. We have only changed the spatial resolution and not the number of gray values yet: _Figure 2.20._\n\n_Figure 2.20 (a)_ depicts a high-resolution image. This means that the spatial rate is extremely fine - a large number of pixels - and the image quality is excellent. If the image is much coarser _(Figure 2.20 (d))_, there are fewer pixels and less density between them. Apparently, the lines and small details in image (a) are very well represented, whereas in image (d), the small details, such as numbers, are difficult to see, making it hard to read the measurements. Assuming that each pixel is represented by 256 levels, images (a) and (d) have the same range of gray values, but due to the difference in resolution, the representation of fine details is obviously different. We will not be able to detect the smooth variation in gray values with coarse spatial discretization.\n\nNext, let's move on to the effects of coarse discretization of gray values, with fixed number of pixels: _Figure 2.21._\n\nAll four of the images above have the same number of pixels: 452x374. The first image, on the other hand, is displayed in 8 bits (256 values). We only use 7 bits or 128 values for image (b) - basically, values 0 and 1 become 0, 2 and 3 become 2, 4 and 5 become 4,… The simplest method is to take each value in image (a), divide it by 2, round down to the nearest integer, and then multiply it by 2.\n\n![[images/image processing/samquanti.png]]\n\nThere are only 64 values in image (c), which is equivalent to dividing by 4, truncating, and then multiplying by 4 - each 4 values is represented by 1 number. So, for example, 0, 1, 2, and 3 become 0; 4, 5, 6, and 7 all become 4, and so on. Finally, there are only 32 values in image (d). The quality appears to be deteriorating. Looking at the lines in the last image, we can see that there are false contours, whereas the transition in the first image is smooth. This is caused by the previously mentioned value jumps.\n\nWe can continue to even more extreme cases: _Figure 2.21._\n\nIn the final image (h), any value less than 128 becomes 0 - black, and any value greater than 128 becomes 255 - white, and the data is of poor quality.\n\n## References\n1.
